# SpawnGenerator
A quick and dirty SQL generator for cmangos tbc-db created in Windows Forms. 

Features are primarily being added when I have a need for them myself, but suggestions are welcome. 

Current features (images in the same order as list):
1. The application supports both MDI childs and separate windows
2. Filter sniff files based on a packet white- or blacklist.
3. Import creature (gameobject support planned) spawn data from sniff files. Sort them by entry, delete duplicates and generate SQL for insertion into tbc-db.
4. Easily generate a large amount of pools based on parameters you enter.
5. Subtract packet timestamps (useful when working on scripts that require delicate timing)
6. Easily add single creature spawns by pasting the position string and other data
